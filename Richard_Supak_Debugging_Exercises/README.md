## Introduction to Debugging

This is the first in a series of exercises designed to improve your debugging skills. You will be presented with a selection of partially solved problems. Your job will be to catch and correct the bugs, so that each method can reliably produce correct answers with the given example input.

Remember that the majority of your time working with code will be spent debugging. The quicker you are at spotting your bugs, the happier and more productive you will be as a developer.

Remember:
- Read the error message
- Check your assumptions
- Refactor as necessary for testability
- Use pry and byebug to test code

These particular problems deal with Enumerable methods and monkey-patching; as you practice debugging, you will also have to draw on your knowledge of Ruby language features and the relevant classes.
